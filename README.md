# FlapyBird

A Flappy Bird Game implementation engined by [`pygame`](https://www.pygame.org/).
Game is re-written based on https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird in an OOP style.

This project was developed & tested on Ubuntu 16.04, using `python3.7.6`.


## Prerequisites

- `python3.7`

## Getting Started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hnqiu/FlappyBird.git

```
Game can be set in 3 modes: `easy`, `median` and `difficult`. Use
```sh
python3 flappybird.py -h
```
to get the usage information.
